## What is it?
Burning Down the House is a tool for FFXIV which gives you more control over placing housing items. Currently, the [BDTHPlugin](https://github.com/LeonBlade/BDTHPlugin) is being prioritized for developement and has more advanced features. Please consider checking it out.

## How do I install it?
Simply download the latest [release](https://github.com/LeonBlade/BurningDownTheHouse/releases/latest) and unzip somewhere to your computer.

## How do I use it?
With the game running, simply run the executable in the folder you unzipped to your computer. From there, you can select a housing item in game, and move it around by changing the coordinates. You can use the mouse wheel to move the coordinates at set increments for ease of use. The "Place Anywhere" checkbox allows you more freedom in where you can place your items.

In order to move your items you **MUST be in ROTATE mode** and then rotate your item after you reposition it to lock in your changes!

## FAQ
I have a [FAQ](https://github.com/LeonBlade/BDTHPlugin/wiki/FAQ) section on the BDTHPlugin Github Wiki that should answer all of the same issues.
